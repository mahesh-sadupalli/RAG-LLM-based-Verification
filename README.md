# RAG-assisted LLM-based Verification

This project explores the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for hardware verification tasks such as:

- 🧪 Formal Verification
- 🐞 Bug Detection and Fixing
- 🔍 Mutation Testing
- ⚙️ SystemVerilog & RISC-V Integration
- 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI)
